# Arrays

In JavaScript, an array is a data structure that allows you to store and organize multiple values in a single variable. Arrays can hold elements of different data types, including numbers, strings, objects, and even other arrays. Each element in an array is assigned a unique index, starting from 0 for the first element.

## Different Functions

### 1. `push()`
Adds one or more elements to the end of an array.
```javascript
let fruits = ['apple', 'banana'];
fruits.push('orange');
// fruits is now ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
```
